## Information

First of all, the cheats I made weren't viruses. And I wanted to quit Growtopia and let people know about it. I  already wanted to make the cheat open source. But a few days later, Discord suspended my account and made it easier to tell people that I was leaving Growtopia. After that, I decided to make the trainer an open source project.

And of course :) Have Fun!!

## Information About The Trainer

The trainer is a .EXE file (executable) because I put the trainer and its files in my Visual Studio project (in the resources folder), which means: EXE is the loader. it is extracting the required files in `"%temp%/NotYetHAX/"`. EXE starts the trainer in `"%temp%/NotYetHAX/NotYetHAXs_Trainer.EXE"`. I know you are wondering why is this an EXE? Because I made a EXE trainer with Cheat Engine (With "`Exe Trainer Generator`")
## Why .EXE? why not .CETRAINER?

Because some people don't know how to install cheat engine and start the trainer with it.. So .EXE is better for those people :)

## Why didn't I turn the trainer into an open source project before?

Because making a Growtopia trainer and looking for cheats was my life (kinda), I thought my cheats were epic and overpowered.
