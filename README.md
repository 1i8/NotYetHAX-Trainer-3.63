# Some Info #

First of all the trainer was not an Virus or anything.. And I was going to quit Growtopia, then let people know about it. Then make the trainer open source. But couple of days later discord banned my account and made it easier to tell people that i quit Growtopia. After that i decided to make the trainer an open source project!

And of course :) Have Fun!!

# Information About The Trainer #

The trainer was an .EXE file (executable) because i put the trainer and its files inside my Visual Studio project (inside the resource directory) mening: EXE was the loader. it was extracting needed files inside "%temp%/NotYetHAX/". EXE was starting the trainer inside "%temp%/NotYetHAX/NotYetHAX's_Trainer.EXE". i know you are wondering why is it an EXE? Because i made the trainer EXE with Cheat Engine (With the "Exe Trainer Generator")
# Why .EXE? why not .CETRAINER? #

Because some people didn't know how to install cheat engine and start the trainer with it.. So .EXE was better for those people :)

# Why didn't i make the trainer an open source project before? #

Because making an Growtopia trainer, and finding cheats was my life (kinda) so i thought my cheats were so epic and overpowered. (until now xd)
